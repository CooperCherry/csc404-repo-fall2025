# Extension Project 1
 
Lox is a pretty minimal language. Propose a feature that you think is missing that would make it more useful for real programming (aside from the standard library). You may research ideas online - if you find lists of suggested features others have come up with, pick one that is particularly compelling to you, research it and write up a proposal.

Your proposal should be a written document of no more than 2 printed pages and provide a motivation, rational, specification of syntax and semantics, and examples. You might model it after a Python "PEP" (like [#572](https://peps.python.org/pep-0572/) or [#736](https://peps.python.org/pep-0736/)).

You may use Internet resources to research and develop your proposal, including gen AI. But you should have full ownership of the final idea and be able to present and defend your proposal on your own.

Your proposal should be a Markdown file which you submit by adding a file [to this repo directory](https://github.com/nadeemabdulhamid/csc404-repo-fall2025/tree/main/projects/01/proposals). You will have to fork a copy of the repo to your GitHub account, add the file to the `projects/01/proposals` directory, and then make a pull request.

In class, a random couple of people will be asked to present your proposal.
